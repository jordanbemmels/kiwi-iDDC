##### Code is to merge all the simulations of a given set of parent directories (corresponding to a particular model), and also print any failed simulations. Then we will also restrict to the number of simulations required. #####
# The code is set up assuming that you have multiple parent directories. Within each parent dir, there are multiple subdirectories that begin with the model prefix (corrseponding to runs from different cores on a HPC cluster). Each subdirectory contains a file ending in "_output_sampling1.txt", which has the simulated summary statistics.
# For example:
	# ./mantelliABC_v6_model_X_DATE1/mantelliABC_v6_model_X_subdir01/mantelliABC_v6_model_X_output_sampling1.txt;
	# ./mantelliABC_v6_model_X_DATE1/mantelliABC_v6_model_X_subdir02/mantelliABC_v6_model_X_output_sampling1.txt;
	# [...];
	# ./mantelliABC_v6_model_X_DATE2/mantelliABC_v6_model_X_subdir01/mantelliABC_v6_model_X_output_sampling1.txt;
	# etc.;

##### USER SETS THESE OPTIONS EACH TIME #####

# there are also some cases where tot_K=2 but the sstats are STILL jumbled, for example heterozygosity in populations 7 and 8 (H_7, H_8) is problematic when K_7 and K_8 is equal to 1 (indicating no variation at any SNP in these populations) - remove these also, by identifying any lines where any K_values are equal to 1;
