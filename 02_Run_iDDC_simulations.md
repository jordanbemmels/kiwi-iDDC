# Running iDDC model simulations

This document describes how to compile directories for each of the iDDC models, and how to run the simulations.

Most of the files are already partly compiled and located in the [model_scripts](https://github.com/jordanbemmels/kiwi-iDDC/tree/main/model_scripts) directory, but some additional organization is needed. In particular, users will need to add executable files for published simulation software, and generic iDDC scripts that have previously been published, as described below.
